# mortgage-loan-prediction-model
This capstone project provides actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investments, and real estate analysis for a banking institution. The main goal is to predict monthly mortgage expenses across various U.S. regions, linking them to monthly family income and real estate rentals.

# Real Estate Price Prediction

This project embarks on a journey to predict real estate prices, delving into a rich dataset of property listings. With a suite of features at our disposal, we engage in exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning model training to unveil patterns and make predictions on property prices.

## Data

The dataset is a compilation of real estate listings, detailed with features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and more. Here are some of the pivotal features:

- **Size**: Total area of the property
- **Location**: Geographical placement of the property
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Total bedrooms in the property
- ...and more

Ensure the dataset is placed at the designated path in the notebook prior to running the code.

## Methods

Our approach encapsulates a series of analytical and machine learning methodologies, listed as follows:

- Conducting thorough exploratory data analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Preprocessing the data, dealing with missing values and outliers
- Partitioning the dataset into training and test sets
- Building and training various machine learning models
- Evaluating models using relevant performance metrics

## Results

The culmination of our analysis and model training will shed light on the significant features that sway real estate prices, enabling us to make precise property price predictions. The Jupyter notebook houses all specific results and detailed findings.

## Usage

To immerse yourself in the analysis and explore the results, fire up the Jupyter notebook and run the cells:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Capstone Prod3.ipynb"
