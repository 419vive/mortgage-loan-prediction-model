# mortgage-loan-prediction-model
This capstone project provides actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investments, and real estate analysis for a banking institution. The main goal is to predict monthly mortgage expenses across various U.S. regions, linking them to monthly family income and real estate rentals.

Real Estate Price Prediction
<p align="justify">
This project embarks on a journey to predict real estate prices, delving into a rich dataset of property listings. With a suite of features at our disposal, we engage in exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning model training to unveil patterns and make predictions on property prices.
