# mortgage-loan-prediction-model
This capstone project provides actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investments, and real estate analysis for a banking institution. The main goal is to predict monthly mortgage expenses across various U.S. regions, linking them to monthly family income and real estate rentals.

Real Estate Price Prediction
<p>This project is focused on predicting real estate prices using various property features. Through rigorous exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning model training, we aim to build accurate and reliable real estate price predictions. The project leverages a comprehensive dataset of property listings, encompassing a wide range of features influencing property prices.</p>
Data
<p>The dataset utilized in this project comprises numerous real estate listings, each described by various features including size, location, number of bedrooms, and more. Below is an overview of some key features present in the dataset:</p>
Size: The total area of the property.
Location: The geographical location of the property.
Number of Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in the property.
